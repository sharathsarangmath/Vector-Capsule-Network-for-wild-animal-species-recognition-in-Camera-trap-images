# Vector Capsule Network for wild animal species recognition in Camera trap images

## Abstract
The most critical task in Ecology is observing and studying the wild animals in their natural
habitat. Camera traps are the most helpful tools for ecologists and researchers for effective
and constant monitoring of wild animals. Monitoring wildlife using camera traps is necessary
as it helps researchers to understand human impacts on wildlife, and also help management to
make better decisions. However, annotating a large amount of camera trap data is
time-consuming. Hence, auto tagging of the wild animal species in camera traps is of great
importance, and its gaining speed as more and more deep learning solutions are being
implemented on a variety of problems. One such computer-assisted system could be an
auto-tagging tool which can classify diverse animal species in real-time.

The author presents a new and novel deep neural networks called 'Capsule Network' as a solution
to the problem of classifying wild animal species. Capsule Network is the latest development
in Artificial Intelligence and is a new and exciting approach to computer vision. It has shown
excellent results on various image recognition problems as per the research published so far.
The work further tests the robustness of the newly introduced 'Capsule Network,' by
comparing its performance with the Convolutional Neural Network. The results achieved
indicate that the Capsule Networks are better at understanding images than ConvNets.

## Hypothesis
The camera trap images of wild animals are the kind of images where Convolutional Neural
Networks may have a problem, because of species exhibiting a variety of poses and therefore,
Capsule Networks can be expected to outperform Convolutional Neural Networks. Capsule
Network has obtained state-of-the-art results on the dataset with the objects with affine
transformations (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.09829.pdf), and can, therefore, be expected to
perform better than Convolutional Neural Networks on camera trap images.

## Research Question 
Is Capsule Network better than Convolutional Neural Network in classifying wild animal
species in camera trap images?
